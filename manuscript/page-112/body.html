Looking at your own Dharma also you ought not to waver, for there is nothing higher for a ksatriya than a righteous war.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>Oneâ€™s own Dharma is to practice kriya. Have that one aim in life steadfastly. Because for ksatriya (brave sadhak) there is no other Dharma than to practice kriya.
Sukha-duhkhe same kritva labhalabhau jayajayau
Tato yuddhaya yujyasva naivam paapam avapsyasi.
