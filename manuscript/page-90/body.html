<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Everything will come of its own if you remain in the after-effect poise of kriya. Do not look outward with attachment. Those who do not hold on to the self and are diverted outward with attachment are all without real character. Those who always hold on to the Self, spontaneously think, analyse and attain the knowledge of the Self. Among naked people if only one person is dressed up, he is ignored. Real solitude is found only when you do not look outward with attachment to anything and to any person.
