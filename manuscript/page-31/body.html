Where is the space for Him to be born and how can there be death for that which is eternal?</p><p>Everything is Brahma.</p><p>Then how could there be change from one thing to another? This is not possible. That which is seen is nothing  but visual delusion. All that is manifested is false and will be dissolved in the Brahma.</p><p>The existence and dissolution of the manifested are all same. That being so, where is the scope for further existence? He is not born from anything because He is self-caused (svayambhu) eternal Being. He never kills because by which instrument will he kill? The instrument by which He will kill is Brahma and the king He will kill is also Brahma? This body is always decaying. How can the decaying instrument kill the deathless, the eternal existence?</p><blockquote><p>Nainam chindanti shastrani nainam dahati pavakah
