So he is not affected by sin. As the atom of the Self is very subtle, so is the atom of the lotus leaf. The atom of water is like that of worldly matters. As a drop of water floats on the surface of a lotus leaf and can not touch it, similarly all actions of a realized soul float on the atom of his self (Brahma), but cannot affect him.</p></div> </div>
