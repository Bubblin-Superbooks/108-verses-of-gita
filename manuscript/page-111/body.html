<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">tolerate them without being disturbed.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The body is made of five elements, that is, earth, water, fire, air and ether and also of muladhar, svadhishthan, manipur, anahat, vishuddha, akaar, ukaar, makaar, naad and bindu. They exist, dissolve and are experienced by air. Beyond them there is the Kutastha Brahma at ajna centre, where when the air is stilled, soundless sound, bindu, naad and the past are known. These are described in scriptures. There is a kind of joy which is known as Supreme Bliss. There is intoxication in this Bliss. So, when one becomes free from the sense perceptions, he becomes free from pain and pleasure. So long as one is attached with the senses, so long he will feel happiness and sorrow. Observe that all experiences are due to sense perceptions.
