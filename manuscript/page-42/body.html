I Myself am the grandfather of all. The secret of all this can be known from the guru. I am the object of knowledge. Nothing in this world is purer than Me. This body is the form of Om and I am in it. Rig, Sama, Yajur-these three when united, make Atharva. All the four sides are My form.</p><blockquote><p>Gatir bharta prabhuh saakshi nivasah sharanam suhrut
