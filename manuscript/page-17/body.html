Yath na vedairdane yajnatirtha bratadivih</p></blockquote><p>Sri Krishna, the son of Devaki is not as pleased by the reading of the Vedas, 
by charity, yajna, pilgrimage or by observing various rites as he is pleased 
by the recitation of the Gita.</p><blockquote><p>Yatra Gita vicharasya pathanan paathhanan srutam
Tatraham nishcitam Paartha! Nivasami sadaiva hi</p></blockquote><p>O Son of Pritha, I surely reside at the place where people recite, read, discuss and listen to the Gita</p>
