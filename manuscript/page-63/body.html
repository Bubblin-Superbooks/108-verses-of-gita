Because in that state there exists no desire for material things, no desire for knowledge even and no other object remains except yourself. When everything culminates into One and you have yourself become that One, then everything is reduced to that One. Therefore, everything becomes known.</p><p>People are mad for knowledge but the knowledge which is worth knowing can be known only if you remain in the after-effect poise of kriya. There cannot be any knowledge without two- the knower and the known. In the after-effect poise of kriya everything becomes One, the second ceases to exist. Therefore, in the absence of two, there comes to an end to knowledge. So, the state which is to be realized through the study of Vedanta, can be attained in the twinkling of an eye and it can put an end to all superficial knowledge.</p></div> </div>
