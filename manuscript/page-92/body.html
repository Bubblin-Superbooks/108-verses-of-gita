In the present circumstances also fight by practising kriya and hold on to the after poise of kriya and overcome the lower self by the higher self.
At the after-effect poise of kriya the seeker attains a state where there are no desires for the results of actions, even of kriya practice.
In the state of desirelessness, which also implies fulfilment of all desires, the seeker attains the state of fulfilment. This is called Siddhi or attainment of success. In other words, the seeker becomes one with the Ultimate Self. He becomes a non doer yet the doer. Such desireless state is also called sannyas. In other words, in the present state of his mind he does not perform unwanted state at the after-effect poise of kriya.
