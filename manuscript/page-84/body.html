One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results onto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful actions as lotus leaf is untouched by water.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>A yogi meditates on the Self and performs all his duties without expectations for results. So he is not affected by sin. As the atom of the Self is very subtle, so is the atom of the lotus leaf. The atom of water is like that of worldly matters. As a drop of water floats on the surface of a lotus leaf and can not touch it, similarly all actions of a realized soul float on the atom of his self (Brahma), but cannot affect him.
