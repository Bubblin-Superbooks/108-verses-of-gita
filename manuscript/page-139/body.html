When one practices 1,728 pranayamas occasionally (this may take morning to 10 pm) he can, after a few days, see the essential nature of all seasons and the earth. If you practice kriya with one pointed attention, you can also see whatever you wish to see.
If one practices pranayama always, the automatically the mind becomes tranquil and the Self is realized (after practising for six months continuously with determined efforts). But this will not happen if the practice is done with the motive for some results.
