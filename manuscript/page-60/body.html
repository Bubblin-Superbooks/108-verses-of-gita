When a yogi draws that juice forcibly with attachment and enters into the qualities of a manifested thing then his kriya practice is not proper. The Ultimate Self is Infinite and so are His qualities. Brahma is infinite infinitum. The individual entity of the sadhak gets lost in that affinity.</p><blockquote><p>Aham vaishvanaro bhutva praninaam deham ashritah
