<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">grieve.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>Do not look at anything with desire. Fix your mind on the Self only and go on practising kriya as instructed by your guru. Remember Him all the time. If you practice kriya regularly, I will make you free from all attachments. Your mind will not be interested in anything at all but will remain established in the after-effect poise of kriya. You need not worry about attainment any more.</p></div> </div>
