One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>The external air of the kriyaban who practices pranayama remains outside. His eyes do not blink and his attention remain fixed between the eyebrows. Prana and apana remain in equilibrium and the air flows inside the nostrils. The senses are restrained and so are his mind and intellect. Such yogis will attain liberation. This is called Jivan mukti or liberation while living in the body. One who is free from desire, fear and anger is ever liberated.
