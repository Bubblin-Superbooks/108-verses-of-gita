My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, unconcerned, free from all pains and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He does not look outward. He does not expect or desire for anything. He is always absorbed in Brahma in the after-effect poise of kriya. He is expert in all types of work. He holds his attention on the head centre and remains at ease. As his attention is at the kutastha, the idea of doing unnecessary work is automatically renounced. He knows that all are transitory enjoyment. He rather enjoys unparalleled eternal bliss in the after-effect poise of kriya. He who has received such bliss by the grace of guru, is naturally dear to his own self.
Yo na hrishyati na dveshti na shochati na kankshati
