He then does not consider anything as his own. Devoid of desire, doubt and duality of pleasure and pain, he remains in the after-effect poise of kriya constantly throughout the day and night. The ignorant people who do not practice kriya can also attain immortality and immutability i.e. the state of after effect poise of kriya.</p><blockquote><p>Manmana bhava madbhaktah madyaji mam namaskuru
Mam eva eshyasi satyam te pratijane priyoâ€™si me.
