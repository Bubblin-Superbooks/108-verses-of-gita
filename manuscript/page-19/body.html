Vyasaena grathitaam Puraana muninaam madhye Mahabaratam
Advaitamruta varshineem bhagavateem ashta dashaa dhyayineem, 
Ambaa twaam anusandadhaami bhagavad geete bhava dweshineem.</p></blockquote><h6>Translation:</h6><p>Om! O Bhagavad Gita with which Partha was enlightened by the Lord Narayana Himself and which was incorporated in the Mahabharata by the ancient Muni Vyasa, O divine mother, the Destroyer of rebirth, showering down the nectar of Advaita, and consisting of eighteen chapters-upon Thee, O Bhagavad Gita! O Affectionate Mother, I meditate.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>Sarvopanishado gaavo dogdha gopalnandanah
