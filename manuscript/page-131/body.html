For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost to him nor is he ever lost to Me.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>He who thus sees Me everywhere, sees Me (the self) in all. He does not destroy Me (the Self) in all. He does not destroy Me (the Self); that is, he never sees anything except Me (the Self). And I also see him (as the Self), that is, I do not see anything except him (as the Self) and I do not destroy (the Self).
