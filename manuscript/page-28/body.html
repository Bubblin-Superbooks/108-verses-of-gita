Sword cannot cut that void which come out of Him. Similarly, when the air is tranquil in the body how then could it be cut to pieces? Kutastha is not burned by fire, nor drenched by water. It cannot be dried by air also. What exactly Kutastha is, one can know clearly only if one receives Kriya initiation and advice from the Guru and practices accordingly.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>Acchedyoâ€™yam</blockquote></div> </div>
