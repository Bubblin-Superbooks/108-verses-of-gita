<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The fragrance of the flowers on the earth has no form. When it comes in contact with nature, it gets smelling. That also is My form. The rays of the sun come through the sky but are seen only when they fall on the earth. Similarly the formless Ultimate Self is invisible but His energy is manifested in the lumbar centre through conversation.</p><p>No body sees “life” i.e the great Lord Mahadeva who is the “Subject” and is known from the words of the guru. It is His movements or actions which are manifested in the life of all beings. Holding on to the Tapoloka i.e Kutastha (the area between the eyebrows) the yogi sees all. That which is not known by the ignorant is in the entire creation. I am that Brahma and all are My forms.</p><blockquote><p>Bijam maam sarvabhutanam viddhi partha sanatanam 
Buddhirbuddhimataam asmi tejastejasvinam aham. 13 (7/10)</p></blockquote><h6>Translation:</h6></div> </div>
