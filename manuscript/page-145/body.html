Free from pride and evil of attachment, ever dwelling in the self, desires completely stilled, liberated from the pairs of opposites (pleasures and pain) the undeluded reach the eternal goal.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>The seeker becomes free from the sense of pride and desire for praise from others. He then does not consider anything as his own. Devoid of desire, doubt and duality of pleasure and pain, he remains in the after-effect poise of kriya constantly throughout the day and night. The ignorant people who do not practice kriya can also attain immortality and immutability i.e. the state of after effect poise of kriya
