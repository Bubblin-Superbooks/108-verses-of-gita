But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>By holding on to the kutasth one attains divine qualities. My delusive energy covers the self. So, if you look at other things beside the Brahma, you will not be able to realize. You will know the self-provided you remain fixed in the self. If you remain far from the self, you will not experience anything. He who always remains in the self, is able to overcome maya and practice kriya.</p><blockquote><p>Anta-kale cha mam eva samran muktva kalevaram
