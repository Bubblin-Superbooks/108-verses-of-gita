Kriya yoga is real science which is found after a great deal of effort. When one remains perfectly attuned with the knowledge of the Self, then one is said to be in the state of yoga. Therefore, one should receive instructions from his guru and practice kriya without entertaining any desire for anything.</p><blockquote><p>Sarvabhutastham atmanam sarvabhutani chatmani
