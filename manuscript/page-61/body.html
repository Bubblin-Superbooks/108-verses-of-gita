<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am the (digestive) fire in the bodies of all living entities and I, joined with the air of life, outgoing and incoming, digest the four kinds of food stuff.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>I digest the four kinds of food by breaking, chewing, licking and drinking through the energy (fire) generated from the equilibrium of prana and apana.  So long as that energy (fire) present in the physical body, the individual being remains alive. When that energy (fire) is gone, life is gone. People say that the body has become cold. The fire is tangible proof of life in the physical body yet people are not interested in kriya. When the presence of such fire or energy cannot make them interested for kriya, then let them do what they want.</p><blockquote><p>Sarvasya chaham hridi samnivistho mattah smrtih jnanam apohanam cha
