He who has attachment is kshara or transitory being and he who keeps his attention inward on the kutastha is akshara i.e. the Eternal Being. Therefore, all beings are transitory i.e. kshara. Only those realized person who hold on to kutastha are immortal. They attain tranquillity but nobody can recognize them. Kutastha is realized only by following the words of the guru. If guru does not show kutastha then you cannot see.</p><blockquote><p>Uttamah purushah tu anyah paramatma iti udahrutah
