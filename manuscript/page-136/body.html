Established thus, one never departs from the truth and upon gaining this, he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken even in the midst of greatest difficulty.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>The seeker does not consider any gain superior to Self-knowledge. This is the supreme gain or perfect attainment as said by the wise men.</p><p>This is why, all scriptures say that one must respect the advice of the realized souls. When one is established in such a state day and night, even in acute suffering he does not feel sorrow or become nervous. In other words, the Kriyaban does not stop practicing kriya even though placed in a tough situation.</p><blockquote><p>Tam vidyat duhkhasamyogaviyogam yoga samjnitam
