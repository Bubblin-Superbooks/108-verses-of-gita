In that state he attains pure devotion to Me.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>When one becomes one with the Ultimate Self, he becomes spontaneously happy as he never looks outward with attachment except the Ultimate Self. With no attachment for any material thing he does not think of anything else. When one looks at a thing with attachment, he develops longing for that thing. When one desires nothing but the Ultimate Self, then he automatically loses all desire.</p><p>He sees the kutastha, the inner Self, in all movable and immovable things. He realizes all automatically. Believing in the words of the Guru and holding onto the Self, he practices kriya always without the desire for results and considers attainment of the Self to be the supreme achievement.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>Bhaktya</blockquote></div> </div>
