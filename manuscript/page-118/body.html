Wise man who is fully equipped with education and knowledge see with equa vision a brahmana, a cow an elephant, a dog and an outcast dog eater.</p><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A realized person will treat a good, learned and polite brahman holding sacred water in a kosa vessel, and an outcast dog eater as equal. At the after effect poise of kriya the realized person like a drunken man, does not make such differences.
