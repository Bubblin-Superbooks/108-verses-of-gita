<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h6>Spiritual Commentary:</h6><p>Having sincere belief in the words of his guru, when someone offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water with real devotion, I accept them all. As some rituals, though false, are accepted as true and followed in sincere belief, in the same way a true seeker, though knows the worldly activities to be unreal, performs them by accepting them as true.
