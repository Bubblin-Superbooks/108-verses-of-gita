The Ultimate Self is doing the works of the Ultimate Self and nothing is done by me. Ultimate Self and nothing is done by me. This is called real surrender. Without practice of kriya, one does not come to the realization that he is one with the Brahma and therefore cannot surrender properly. When one becomes one with Brahma all surrender ceases because then who will surrender to whom?
