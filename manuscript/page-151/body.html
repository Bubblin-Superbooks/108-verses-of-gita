Remain concentrated in the kutastha i.e Me and have faith in the words of the guru as you actually get results. Therefore, do not desire for anything else. Established in the pure Brahma treat everybody as equal. You will have no enmity towards anybody</p><p>He who remains in this state realizes Me. This implies that he remains absorbed in himself in the state of after effect poise of kriya.</p><blockquote><p>Shreyo hi jnanam abhyasat jnanat dhyanam vishishyate
