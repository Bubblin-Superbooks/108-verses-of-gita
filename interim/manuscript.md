### Foreword

During the eventide of my life. I have started believing in the eternal truth that the sacred knowledge of Gita is Godlike. I now realize beyond doubt that there is no necessity of reading many scriptures.

After careful and long study of the Gita I most humbly present the transcendental truth of the Gita through 108 verses. Only after contemplating over all the seven hundred verses of the Gita, these one hundred and eight verses, pregnant with esoteric meaning, have been coined. The one and only aim of this work is to provide the practitioner of experimental metaphysics the quintessence of the principles of spirituality to enable him to contemplate on Him deeply.

The Bhagavad-Gita is a confluence of wisdom, action and devotion. Whoever does circumambulation of the “Gita-shrine” daily will definitely become illumined by the grace of Lord Krishna. Have no doubt about that.

Who is Vasudeva Krishna? What are his features and where is his abode?

The Lord Himself has revealed these facts through the medium of different verses. One should remember these shlokas like mantras, concentrate and meditate on them daily. Subsequently his contemplation and meditation of the Lord Krishna will become perfect.

Lord Krishna Himself is the greatest yogi, the Almighty and the epithet of Lord Vishnu. The Bhagavad-Gita is the liberating garland of supernatural jewels which have come out of the mouth of the Lord Himself. Whoever dives daily in the confluence of action, wisdom and devotion as explained in the Gita and dwells on its teachings will surely attain liberation.

I have provided the Spiritual Commentary of these verses as interpreted by revered Sri Sri  Lahiri Mahasaya. It is my firm belief that any devotee who deeply meditates on them will be immensely benefited in his journey towards self-realization.

At the first glance, the commentaries may appear very secret and difficult to understand. But a deep contemplation of their esoteric sense will reveal the inner meaning.

The spiritual commentary by Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya has been translated into English from Bengali.

Lastly, I pray to my beloved Gurudeva for granting his all powerful blessings to those, especially to Dr. B. Prasad, VSM Wg Commander (Retd), MD (Med) DM (Card) of Noida (U.P), Sri Sandip Majumdar of Kolkata and Sri Sampad Ghosh of Ghatsila who helped me in bringing out the English version of the book. I also sincerely pray to God for fulfilment of their spiritual endeavour.

I shall feel satisfied and well rewarded and my dream fulfilled if the spiritual aspirant gets immersed in the devotion of Lord Krishna after reading this book and is fully absorbed in the path of self realization
